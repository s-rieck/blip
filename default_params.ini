## General run parameters
fmin=1e-4
fmax=1e-2
## Duration in seconds, should be compatiable with fmin.
duration=8e6
## Segment length for fft in seconds, should be compatiable with fmin
# Note by SB: Looks like this needs to be at least a factor of 10 larger than 1/fmin to give consistant recoveries.
seglen=1e5
## Sample rate in Hz, should be compatible with fmax
# Note by SB: Looks like this needs to be atleast a factor of 4
# higher than fmax (as opposed to the usual factor of 2) to give
# consistent recoveries.

Shfile=LISA_2017_PSD_M.npy
## Healpix nside (skymap resolution)
nside=2
## Start time in seconds. Determines starting orbital postion.
tstart = 0

## LISA configuration. Can be stationary or orbiting
lisa_config=orbiting

## Level of the tdi. Can be michelson, xyz or aet
tdi_lev=xyz

# If the mldc flag is set to 1, then the time series data is read in from a file.
mldc=0
datafile=mldc_tdi_withnoise.txt

# Doppler or strain data. MLDC data is doppler, autogenerated data is strain. Can be doppler or strain.
datatype=strain

## If loadResponse is true, then a previously generated set of detector responses is read in from a file. Only use when running repeated analyses on the same data set. 
# File loaded depends on tdi_lev.
# Note - due to code improvements, this can probably be depreciated.
loadResponse=0

## If loadCustom is also true, the detector response arrays will be loaded from files specified by the user (responsefile1,2,3). Specified detector responses should be compatible with tdi_lev.
# IMPORTANT - only load responses when analyzing the dataset originally used to generate them. The code will throw an error if the duration/segment length (dur/seglen) don't match. However, mismatched combinations of data and responses can still function in some cases and will produce erroneous results.

## Recovery model type, can be isgwb, sph_sgwb, dwd_fg, isgwb_only or noise_only for now
modeltype=isgwb
## Recovery spectrum model, for use with the dwd_fg model. Can be 'powerlaw', 'broken_powerlaw', or 'truncated_powerlaw'
# 'truncated_powerlaw' is a broken power law where the slope of the second power law is fixed.

## Sampler to use. Supported: dynesty, emcee

## What type of simulated signal to add? Same choices as modeltype above. 
injtype=isgwb

## Galactic Foreground Injection
# Which kind of spatial injection to do. Can be a simple model with rh and zh as parameters ('breivik2020') or generated from a full binary catalogue ('population')
fg_type=breivik2020

## For the breivik2020 model:
# Disk geometry; thin disk has rh=2.9kpc, zh=0.3kpc; Thick disk has rh=3.31kpc, zh=0.9kpc.

# Delimiter used in data file. For tab- and space-delimited files, enter tab or space, respectively
delimiter=space
# SNR cut used to determine resolved vs. unresolved sources
SNRcut=7

## Foreground Spectrum Type; Foreground can be a simple power law ('powerlaw'), a more realistic truncated spectrum ('truncated'), a broken power law ('broken_powerlaw'), or (WIP) created from a binary population catalogue ('population')
fg_spectrum=population
# log cutoff frequency for truncated power law/break frequency for the broken power law
log_fcut=-2.77
# spectral index of the second powerlaw for the broken_powerlaw spectrum
alpha2=-20

## if inj_type==sph_sgwb what are the blm values.
# Complex quantities in a comma seperated list in healpix order
# b00 can only be 1. b_{l, -m} = (-1)**m b_lm

# Projection used for making skymaps. Can be 'E' (ecliptic) or 'G' (galactic)

# number of live points for the dynesty sampler

# For multiprocessing, number of threads
# Warning: most often, multithreading the dynesty sampler does not result in significant gains as its proposal process must be serial.
Nthreads=1
# If FixSeed is true, the sampler will use random states generated by the seed given in the 'seed' parameter below. This allows for reproduction of sampling results; for a given seed value, repeated analyses of the same dataset will produce precisely identical results. The seed can be any unsigned 32-bit integer.

## Checkpointing and restarting (dynesty only)
# If checkpoint is true, the sampler will save its current state every checkpoint_interval seconds.
# To resume an interrupted checkpointed run, run blip on the copy of the params file in the output directory with 'resume' as an additional argument
# e.g. python3 run_blip.py [path/to/out_dir/params_file] resume
checkpoint=1
